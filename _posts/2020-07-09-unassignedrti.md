If you have been involved in monitoring and observing data for COVID-19 you may have seen a category **Cases being reassigned to states** or **Unassigned**. These were the numbers that were added on the MOHFW site as a "Cases being reassigned to states" category.

Many of you asked us on various mediums about this category as the total count would reduce/increase every morning based on this category.


So, one of our volunteers had filed an RTI (Right to Information) to get the details about this category with Ministry of Health and Family Welfare on 20/06/2020. It was transferred to NCDCD (National Centre for Disease Control, Delhi) on 20/06/2020. NCDC is the institute under the Indian Directorate General of Health Services, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. It was established in July 1963 for research in epidemiology and control of communicable diseases and to reorganize the activities of the Malaria Institute of India.  
The reason for transferring was that the data regarding COVID-19 is monitored under IDSP (Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme). It is the backbone of India’s disease monitoring network and is set up under NCDC. It is responsible for alerting the central government and the wider world on a weekly basis about the emergence of disease outbreaks, surge in novel pathogens, the rate of spread and remedial action taken to control diseases.
